# Finite-Automata
Each node represents a state, and transitions between nodes correspond to characters in the input string. Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) allow multiple transitions from one state to another, while Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) have a unique transition for each input symbol.
